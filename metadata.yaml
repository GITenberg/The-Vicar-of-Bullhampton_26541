description: "The Vicar of Bullhampton is an 1870 novel by Anthony Trollope. It is\
  \ made up of three intertwining subplots: the courtship of a young woman by two\
  \ suitors; a feud between the titular Broad church vicar and a Low church nobleman,\
  \ abetted by a Methodist minister; and the vicar's attempt to rehabilitate a young\
  \ woman who has gone astray.\nTrollope expected his depiction of a fallen woman\
  \ to be controversial, and unusually for him wrote a preface defending it. But the\
  \ anticipated controversy never materialised, and contemporary reviewers tended\
  \ to ignore that subplot, focussing instead on the courtship in the novel. Reviews\
  \ were generally less than positive; many reviewers and readers who had acquired\
  \ a taste for Trollope from the 1850sâ€“60s Barchester novels were unhappy about the\
  \ darker tone of later novels such as this one.\nTrollope's fortunes suffered because\
  \ of the mode of the novel's publication. Owing to mismanagement by the publishers,\
  \ it was not serialised in a popular magazine, as originally intended. Instead,\
  \ it was issued as monthly numbers, a form of serialisation that had become unpopular\
  \ with the reading public, and Trollope lost readers as a result.\n From Wikipedia\
